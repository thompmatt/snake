This personal program is my recreation of the classic **Snake** game. The program utilizes the Pygame module and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The snake is defined as a list of 'Squares,' which is one of the objects in the code. Game runs in a 600 x 600 window.

The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat food or snacks to grow! However, make sure while you are out hunting for food that you do not eat yourself! That would hurt...

This personal project allowed me to practice various things:
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- User Interfaces (UI) in Python
- Basic video game design (Main menu, difficulties, help section, high scores, control and game flow)
- File I/O in Python (Saving/reading scores)

and much more! This was one of my favorite programming projects to work on.

## Main Menu

</p>

The main menu screen contains the title and author, as well as a few navigation buttons:
- Easy: Play **Snake** on Easy difficulty.
- Normal: Play **Snake** on Normal difficulty.
- Hard: Play **Snake** on Hard difficulty.

The difficulties change based on how fast or slow the game runs. If Normal were to be at 1x speed, Easy mode runs at 0.75x the actual speed and Hard mode runs at 1.5x. (The idea for difficulties was thanks to my sister who thought it was too difficult and my girlfriend's father, who wanted a more intense challenge.)

Furthermore, one can see two buttons in the top right corner of the screen:
- Achievements: Shows your highest scores for every mode (Easy, Normal, Hard). Allows the user to reset if they desire!
- Help: Provides a brief description of how to play the **Snake** game.

## Downloading and Compiling

To run the application, you can do one of two things:
1. Navigate to the main [**Snake**](https://github.com/thompmatt/Snake) page. In the right side under [Releases](https://github.com/thompmatt/Snake/releases/tag/1.0), you can download the installer.
2. Download the 'snakeGame.py' file and:
- Open CMD or Terminal. (Make sure Python and the Pygame module are installed)
- Navigate towards the location of the file.
- To run, type "python snakeGame.py". (If "python" doesn't work, try "python3")
